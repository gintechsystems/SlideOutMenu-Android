SlideOutMenu-Android
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gintechsystems/SlideOutMenu-Android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gintechsystems/SlideOutMenu-Android)

Hello, here you can find a refined version of the old SlidingMenu from jfeinstein10. This project has been updated to use the latest Android SDK. I have cleaned up the deprecated code & using support libaries to go back to Android API 15. It also includes bug fixes & the ability to easily add it to your build.gradle from jCenter or MavenCentral.

I would like to maintain this project as it was always a very valuable library to me. I appreciate all the work that jfeinstein10 has done for us. If anyone does pull requests or has issues let me know, I will definitely keep an eye on them!


Please come back soon as I will update this README with How-To & Usage.
